# Garter
A simple and harmless foundation for a Python-based computer virus capable of infecting nearby files and executing a specific payload.

Anyone is welcome to use code from this repository, but know that I am not responsible for any damage done by any modified versions of the file.

Note that this code is very much so in an alpha phase. It is nowhere near operational yet. Check back later to see when it's functional.
